Pepperflipping is a tradition of students at Bowdoin College, and this online game attempts to bring it into the digital age. View live demo at http://ruben.codes/pepperflip

This project uses Three.js, a Javascript 3D rendering library, to create a simulated Pepperflip game. It also uses PhoneGap as an iOS wrapper and relies on iOS 8's new support for WebGL.
